REST (Representational State Transfer) is a protocol (HTTP / ...) and forma t(JSON/XML/...) independent architecture style for hypermedia systems.

REST is defined by six constraints originally described by [Roy Fielding](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf). This six constrainbts are :
-  Uniform interface
-  Stateless
-  Cache enabled
-  Client / Server
-  Layered System
-  Code on demand

This document is intended to be used as a developer guide. It contains best practices to respect during the development of a REST based service oriented architecture. This guide focuses on the HTTP protocol exclusively and the JSON/XML data exchange formats
